This is my first ML project.

I will use the widely known Iris Flower Dataset to practice with some 
beggining ML scripts, and, as I advance in my studies, I will try other approaches.

In first sight, I'll be using some LinearClassification algorithms, to create
an model based on the dataset.
In the future, I may try other algorithms.

In the LinearClassification example, the "Iris-Setosa" species will be classified as 0,
the "Iris-Versicolor" species will be classified as 1 and the "Iris-Virginica" species
will be classified as 2.
